    const prompt = `Analyze the law text and generate ${numItems} distinct TikTok video scripts. First, identify the key themes and aspects of: ${description}

Law text:
<law_text>
${lawText}
</law_text>

First, explain your reasoning about what distinct aspects of the law each video should cover and why they would make engaging content.

Then, provide exactly ${numItems} sets of responses in XML format, each set containing these tags in order:
<video_script>The actual TikTok script with intro and outro. This should be written in a friendly influencer style.</video_script>
<keywords>Provide at least 10 comma-separated search terms for background videos that match the timeline of your script. Each term will be used to find a video clip that plays during that part of the script. For example, if your script talks about "driving in rain" followed by "school zones", include those exact terms in that order.</keywords>
<title>An engaging video title</title>

Make each script friendly and use typical influencer style. Include a catchy intro like "Hey TikTok!" and an engaging outro like "Don't forget to follow for more legal tips!"

Do not output markdown, just XML. Separate each set with a newline.

Here is an example output for one set:
<video_script>Hey TikTok! Your favorite legal bestie here with some CRAZY speed limit facts you need to know! ðŸ¤¯

Did you know that speed limits aren't just random numbers? They're actually based on safety studies and road conditions! Mind = blown, right?

Let me break it down for you:
- 25 mph in neighborhoods (protect those kiddos!)
- 55 mph on regular roads (keep it steady!)
- And ALWAYS slow down for curves and bad weather (duh!)

The tea is: you can actually get a ticket even if you're going the speed limit... if conditions are dangerous! ðŸ˜±

Stay safe out there besties! Don't forget to follow for more legal tips that could literally save your life! âœ¨ #LegalTok #DrivingSafety #RoadRules</video_script>
